## Introduction
Are you still wasting your widescreen? Snow Star invites you to experience 2D typesetting in the 21st century!

Do you feel like you are limited by black-rimmed glasses when looking at the empty gray backgrounds on both sides; as if you are just reading a leopard in a tube; or are you crazy sliding the wheel just to control the content before and after the article?

**The times have changed, lord! **

The width of a person's field of vision affects the reading efficiency of TA, which in turn affects the breadth, depth, and height of thinking.

Now, let us examine everything you read with a higher perspective!

## The main function of this plugin:

Automatically recognize long articles, re-column layout with a width of about 32 characters per line, and change to column + horizontal scrolling reading, just like reading newspapers when I was a child.

Operation/use instructions:
-`Escape`: If the page is misplaced, Escape can be restored
-`Scroll`: the scroll wheel is half a screen, and the page elements are automatically scrolled horizontally first
-`Click`: scroll to read the current article

Keywords: Quickly improve visual dimension / Brush zhihu artifact / Luxury wide-angle widescreen viewing angle / Horizontal scroll reading mode / Page turning mode / Make full use of screen space / Quick reading speed reading plug-in / Snow reading mode
